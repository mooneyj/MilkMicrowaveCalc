# Milk Warmer Calculator

A simple yet precise Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to calculate microwave heating times for baby milk. This tool helps parents quickly determine the optimal time to warm milk to body temperature (37°C) based on volume and starting temperature.

## Features:

- Calculates heating time for milk volumes between 30-130ml
- Adjustable starting temperature
- Based on physics principles of heat transfer
- Works offline as a PWA
- Compatible with both Android and iOS devices

## How it works:

This calculator uses a formula derived from the physics of heating, taking into account:
- Microwave efficiency
- Specific heat capacity of milk
- Density of milk

The app provides a quick, easy-to-use interface for parents to ensure their baby's milk is heated to the perfect temperature, every time.

## Usage:

1. Enter the volume of milk in milliliters
2. Enter the starting temperature (defaults to 3°C for refrigerated milk)
3. Click 'Calculate' to get the recommended microwave time

## Note:

Always test the temperature of the milk before feeding and adjust heating times based on your specific microwave's performance.
